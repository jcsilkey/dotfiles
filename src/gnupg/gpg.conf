# (OpenPGP-Esoteric-Options)
# Use name as the message digest algorithm used when signing a key. Running the
# program with the command --version yields a list of supported algorithms. Be
# aware that if you choose an algorithm that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP
# implementations do not, then some users will not be able to use the key
# signatures you make, or quite possibly your entire key.

# SHA-1 is the only algorithm specified for OpenPGP V4. By changing the
# cert-digest-algo, the OpenPGP V4 specification is not met but with even
# GnuPG 1.4.10 (release 2009) supporting SHA-2 algorithm, this should be safe.

# (OpenPGP-Protocol-Options)
# Specify how many times the passphrases mangling for symmetric encryption is
# repeated. This value may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive. The
# default is inquired from gpg-agent. Note that not all values in the
# 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected, GnuPG will
# round up to the nearest legal value. This option is only meaningful if
# --s2k-mode is set to the default of 3.
